## Documentation

Documentation is automatically generated from docstrings with Doxygen on each push to master and it can be found in the "Docs" folder.
Github allows to easily host documentation on Pages deployment, but unfortunately that is not possible for private repos.

A sample Action on how to achieve that is provided in docs generation Action.
